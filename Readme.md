# Latent.jl

Latent.jl is a julia package that contains a variety of latent variable models. These models use either Expectation-Maximization or MCMC sampling.

It currently contains an implementation of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) used to cluster continuous data. A future version of the package will also contain an implementation of a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) by means of full posterior sampling.
